                        <h1>Double Or Quits</h1>
                        <h2><a href="https://github.com/rdlou/double-or-quits" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>
                        <p>There was a project going on a work with web componenets. I wanted to play around and see what they were like. I've been joking with my brother in law about a payment option called Double or Quits, so decided to build that.
                        The entire project was built with JS and I used a library called Hybrids.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Initial Plan</h2>
                        <p>In the first instance, I just wanted to create something incredibly simple that didn't even really do anything. I went through a few youtube tutorials and then built on top of the basics.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-image"> <!-- Updated class -->
                        <img src="../assets/double-or-quits.gif" /> <!-- Path is correct -->
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Tech Stuff</h2>
                        <p>Nothing too inspiring here. I started off writing my web component in vanilla js. Once I understood how that was working I moved onto a package called hyrids.
                        Hybrids was good to work with as it took a lot of the boiler plate stuff out, however the name is a little generic which meant googling certain issues was occasionally tricky. I found a few things unnecessarily complicated, and I'm not 100% sure if I've done correctly, like how I import the css. However, it seems to work well.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Results</h2>
                        <p>I'm happy with the result. Obviously the prospect of a Double Or Quits payment method is quite rediculous, but the project allowed me to dig further into web components. I enjoy writing in JS. As my starting point in development was Python, and I work a lot on Java nowadays, it was nice to go back to something a little more high level. I found that allows for a lot more playful programming.</p>
