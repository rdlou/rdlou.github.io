                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Rob Loustau and I'm a senior software engineer based in London. I currently work at <a href="https://complyadvantage.com/" target="_blank">ComplyAdvantage</a>, where I help build and maintain our financial crime detection tools.</p>
                <p>Right now I'm in a team called Upgrade, working on the systems that move clients onto our new platform, and our orchestration-layer which manages workflows for screening customers and transactions.</p>
                <p>Before that I worked on our Identity & API team - building plugins, shaping how our platform handles authentication and authorization, and working with Kong as a gateway and Auth0 as an idp provider.</p>
                <p>Prior to Comply, I was at Temenos, helping banks integrate third-party services into their core systems.</p>
                <p>Most of my work is in Kotlin, though I also write Lua when needed and use Python for personal projects- small tools, experiments, and ideas I want to explore quickly.</p>
                <p>Outside of tech, I like Spike Milligan, Michael Lewis, the New Forest, guitar, snowboarding, DIY, running, Bob Mortimer's Train guy and flats with non visible plug points.</p>
